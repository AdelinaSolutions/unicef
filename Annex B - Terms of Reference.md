# SHORT TITLE OF ASSIGNMENT
Development, Integration, and Maintenance of an AI-Enabled Interactive Voice Response (IVR) System and Online Feedback
Platform for UNICEF Ukraine’s Feedback and Complaint Mechanism “Say it as it is”

# BACKGROUND
UNICEF Ukraine is committed to strengthening its Accountability to Affected Populations (AAP) by ensuring that children,
caregivers, and communities have safe, accessible, and responsive mechanisms to express concerns, complaints, and
feedback. The “Say it as it is” hotline and online platform maintained by the UCO are central to these efforts.

To improve efficiency and reduce dependence on human resources, UNICEF Ukraine aims to transition the hotline to a
technology-enabled system using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Interactive Voice Response (IVR), while also maintaining and
integrating the existing online platform. This will ensure 24/7 accessibility, expanded coverage, and seamless user experience
across channels.

# OBJECTIVE
The key objectives of this assignment include:

-  Develop, deploy, and maintain an AI-driven voice assistant and IVR system.
-
-

Ensure full integration with, and ongoing maintenance of, the existing “Say it as it is” online platform.
Provide a comprehensive, scalable, and secure multi-channel feedback and complaint system operational from
October 2025 with maintenance until 31 December 2025, with possible extension for up to 1-year, subject to the
successful performance.

### SCOPE OF WORK, ACTIVITIES, TASKS, DELIVERABLES AND TIMELINES

1.  Design, development, and deployment of an AI-enabled voice assistant using advanced LLMs and real-time voice

recognition, accessible via PSTN, VoIP, and web/mobile apps.

2.  Full technical integration and ongoing maintenance of the existing “Say it as it is” online platform currently

maintained by UCO with support of the vendor, ensuring continuity, upgrades, and harmonization with the new voice
solution.

3.  Real-time voice-to-text transcription with user-friendly web access, editing, and export features.
4.  Data security and privacy compliance, including encryption, access control, GDPR alignment, and incident recovery.
5.  System scalability and reliability, including support for 100+ concurrent calls, 99.9% uptime, and disaster recovery

within 4 hours.

6.  AI model training and continuous improvement, using user feedback loops to enhance performance.
7.  Analytics dashboard with real-time performance reports, conversation tagging, and trends visualization.
8.  Training and technical support, including user documentation and 24/7 assistance post-deployment.
9.  Language support for Ukrainian and other locally relevant dialects, including handling of code-switching and accent

variation.

10.  Custom escalation logic, enabling rerouting to human operators for sensitive or unresolved issues.
11.  User interface for UNICEF admins, including prompt customization, feedback review, and knowledge base updates.

## CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION - INSTITUTIONS

Criteria

1.  Technical proposal

2.  Financial proposal

Total maximum points to be attributed

Maximum points

Minimum technical required  score: 70% (49 points). Technical Proposals scoring less than 49 points will be considered
nonresponsive, therefore will be rejected.

Weighted scoring evaluation approach
The evaluation criteria will be a split between technical and commercial (price proposal) scores (70/30 split).
Proposals submitted in response to this RFP should include and will be evaluated against the following:

Revised 27 Aug 2022
1.  Technical evaluation: Terms of reference includes technical evaluation criteria. Total maximum 70 points.
Only proposals which receive a minimum of 70% (49 points) will be considered further.
2.  Price proposals. The total amount of points allocated for the price component is 30.

The maximum number of points will be allotted to the lowest price proposal that is opened and compared among those
invited firms/institutions which obtain the threshold points in the evaluation of the technical component. All other price
proposals will receive points in inverse proportion to the lowest price, e.g.: Score for price proposal X = (Max. score for
price proposal 30 Points) * Price of lowest priced proposal) / Price of proposal X.

Total obtainable Technical and Price points: 100

The Proposer(s) achieving the highest combined technical and price score will (subject to any negotiations and the various
other rights of UNICEF detailed in this RFPS) be awarded the contract(s).
