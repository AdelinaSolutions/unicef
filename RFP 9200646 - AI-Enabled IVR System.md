Proposal Evaluation Approach.

Weighted scoring evaluation approach

The evaluation criteria will be a split between technical and commercial (price proposal) scores
(70/30 split).

Proposals submitted in response to this RFPS should include and will be evaluated against the
following:

a) Technical Evaluation - see Annex B: Terms of Reference incl. Technical Evaluation Criteria.

Total Maximum 70 Points

Only Proposals which receive a minimum of 70% (49 points) will be considered further.

b) Price Proposal (commercial evaluation)

The total amount of points allocated for the price component is 30. The maximum number of
points will be allotted to the lowest price proposal that is opened and compared among those
invited firms/institutions which obtain the threshold points in the evaluation of the technical
component. All other price proposals will receive points in inverse proportion to the lowest price;
e.g.:

Score for price proposal X = (Max. score for price proposal 30 Points) * Price of lowest priced
proposal) / Price of proposal X

Total obtainable Technical and Price points: 100

1.4
Immunities provides, inter alia, that the United Nations, including UNICEF as a subsidiary organ,

Implementation

No Reliance. Except as expressly set out in the RFPS documents,

2.1
UNICEF will have no obligation to provide any assistance to the contractor and UNICEF makes
no representations as to the availability of any facilities, equipment, materials, systems or
licenses which may be helpful or useful for the performance of the work.

must be explicitly detailed in its Proposal.

Sub-contractors. Proposers must identify in their Proposal, any

2.2
products which may be offered by themselves, but originate from another supplier and/or
country. Further, Proposers must
identify in their proposal any planned subcontracting of
services. All subcontracting arrangements will be reviewed by UNICEF as part of its evaluation
of the Proposal.

2.3
If so required in the Terms of Reference/Statement of Work
each key expert profile requested in the Terms of Reference/Statement of Work must sign an
exclusivity and availability statement. The purpose of Exclusivity and Availability Statement is as

the Proposal, UNICEF expects the contract to be executed by these specific experts. As the
expected date of mobilization is given in the RFPS, UNICEF will only consider substitutions after
the deadline for the submission of offers in cases of unexpected delays in the commencement
date beyond the control of the Proposer, or exceptionally because of the incapacity of a key

replacement and which would not have any effect on the selection of the Proposal. The desire of
a Proposer to use an expert on another project or a change of mind on the part of an expert
about the contract will not be accepted as a reason for substitution of any of the key experts.

Joint Ventures. The description of the organization of the joint

2.4

the joint venture in delivering the requirements of this RFPS, both in the Proposal and the Joint

those required in this RFPS, it should present such information in the following manner:

Contractor’s invoice(s). Such liquidated damages will be calculated as follows: one half of one
per cent (0.5%) of the Contract Fee for the delayed Services and Deliverables for each day of

the time-based rate for all the Contractor Personnel required to provide the relevant Services or
Deliverables, until performance of conforming Services or delivery of conforming Deliverables,
