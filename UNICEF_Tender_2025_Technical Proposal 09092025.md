1. Executive Summary

This proposal outlines a comprehensive solution to design, develop, and maintain a robust AI-powered
Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system to enhance UNICEF Ukraine’s existing “Say it as it is” feedback and
complaint mechanism.

The solution will create a multi-channel, user-centric communication platform accessible via traditional
telephony (PSTN), VoIP, web, and mobile apps. Building on the current online platform already operated by our
team, this system ensures continuity of service, seamless data migration, and enhanced features without
operational disruption.

Leveraging advanced large language models (LLMs), speech recognition technologies, and real-time analytics,
the platform will deliver 24/7 availability, high scalability, and strict security compliance, supporting rural
populations and vulnerable groups. UNICEF will gain a fully integrated toolset to process and respond to high
volumes of feedback efficiently while reducing dependency on manual operations.

2. System Architecture and Technologies

The proposed solution is based on a microservices architecture, containerized with Docker and orchestrated via
Kubernetes clusters.

Key features:

•  Hybrid Cloud Model: Multi-zone deployments ensuring 99.9% uptime and disaster recovery objectives

within 4 hours.

•  Voice Processing Layer: Handles inbound/outbound calls, transcription, and speech recognition.

•  AI Conversation Engine: LLM-powered, customized for UNICEF-specific terminology and complaint

workflows.

•

Integration Layer: Bi-directional synchronization with the “Say it as it is” platform.

•  Analytics & Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK Stack for system monitoring; Power BI/Tableau

for insights.

•

Security Layer: RBAC, MFA, AES-256 encryption, ISO 27001 and GDPR compliance.

3. AI-Enabled IVR System

The AI-driven IVR enables natural, conversational voice interactions:

•

Intent and sentiment detection to route calls intelligently.

•  Automatic escalation of complex issues to human agents.

•

Support for 100+ concurrent calls with low latency.

•  Accurate recognition of Ukrainian, Russian, and dialects (Surzhyk).

•  Automated updates and case references for transparency.

4. Integration with Existing Platform

Adelina Solutions currently maintains the “Say it as it is” platform, providing unmatched knowledge for
seamless integration:

•  Unified database for all voice and web cases.

•  Real-time synchronization for consistent case management.

•

•

Single admin dashboard for UNICEF staff.

Future-proof API layer for new integrations (e.g., messaging apps).

5. Transcription and Search

•  High-accuracy automated transcription with manual correction.

•

•

Full-text search and filtering by user, topic, time, and sentiment.

Sentiment analytics to flag emergencies or dissatisfaction patterns.

•  Export capabilities in .txt, .csv, .pdf.

6. Security and Data Privacy

•  Encryption: TLS/SSL in transit, AES-256 at rest.

•  Access Controls: MFA, SSO, biometrics.

•  DDoS Protection: Cloudflare/Azure protection.

•  Compliance: ISO 27001, GDPR standards.

•  Audit Logs: Full activity logging for accountability.

7. Analytics and Reporting

•  Real-time dashboards with system health metrics.

•  Predictive analytics for demand forecasting.

•  Automated case categorization and sentiment tagging.

•  Configurable reporting templates for UNICEF stakeholders.

8. Scalability and Reliability

•  Horizontal scaling with Kubernetes clusters.

•

Load balancing for peak performance.

•  Redundant systems for regional outages.

•  CDN integration for low-latency web access.

9. Maintenance and Technical Support

•  24/7 monitoring and SLA-driven response times.

•  Regular updates and automated deployment pipelines.

•  Quarterly security audits and optimization reviews.

•  Continuous improvement of AI models.

10. Training and Handover

•  Workshops: Hands-on training for administrators, operators, and IT staff.

•  Comprehensive Documentation: Manuals, FAQs, and workflow guides.

•  Knowledge Transfer: Full capability handover for UNICEF autonomy.

11. Competitive Advantages

•  Proven Expertise: Existing “Say it as it is” development and support team.

•  Cutting-Edge AI: Integration of GPT-5, Claude 4, Gemini 2.5.

•  Cultural Context: Dialect and linguistic nuances of Ukraine supported.

•

Security-First: Alignment with UNICEF’s highest security standards.

•  Agile Delivery: Fast implementation with no quality compromise.
